## 1. Overview

### 1.1 Purpose

Validation Pipeline Interface defines the **AI Safety Layer** that orchestrates parallel quality checks (Lint, Tests, Coverage) for AI-generated code. Part of EP-02 (Auto-Fix Engine), this pipeline ensures AI-generated PRs meet quality standards before merging, with <6 minute p95 latency and non-blocking validator failures.

### 1.2 Scope

**In Scope:**
- ValidationPipeline orchestration service (parallel execution with asyncio.gather)
- BaseValidator abstract class interface (validate() method contract)
- LintValidator implementation (ruff for Python, ESLint for TypeScript)
- TestValidator implementation (pytest for Python, vitest for TypeScript)
- CoverageValidator implementation (pytest-cov, threshold 80%)
- Redis queue architecture (FIFO queue, retry sorted set, processing hash)
- ValidatorResult and PipelineResult data structures
- Prometheus metrics (duration histograms, result counters, queue gauges)
- Background worker with automatic retry (exponential backoff: 10s, 20s, 40s)

**Out of Scope:**
- SecurityValidator (SAST) - covered in SPEC-0001 (Semgrep integration)
- ContextValidator - covered in SPEC-0002 (5 CTX checks)
- Auto-fix generation - separate service in EP-02

### 1.3 Key Metrics

| Metric | Target | Tier | Measurement |
|--------|--------|------|-------------|
| Pipeline p95 Latency | <6 minutes | ALL | End-to-end validation time |
| Lint p95 Latency | <2 minutes | ALL | ruff + ESLint execution time |
| Test p95 Latency | <5 minutes | STANDARD+ | pytest + vitest execution time |
| Coverage p95 Latency | <5 minutes | PROFESSIONAL+ | pytest-cov execution time |
| Queue Wait p95 | <30 seconds | ALL | Redis queue → worker pickup time |
| Blocking Rate | <20% | ALL | % PRs blocked by validation failures |
| False Positive Rate | <5% | ALL | % incorrect FAILED results |

## 2. Functional Requirements

### FR-001: ValidationPipeline Orchestration Service

**Description**: ValidationPipeline orchestrates parallel execution of validators (Lint, Test, Coverage) using asyncio.gather, aggregates results, and applies tier-based pass/fail logic.

**BDD Requirements:**

```gherkin
Feature: ValidationPipeline Orchestration
  As a Backend Service
  I want to orchestrate parallel validator execution
  So that AI-generated PRs are validated in <6 minutes

  Background:
    Given ValidationPipeline is initialized with tier "PROFESSIONAL"
    And validators are registered: [LintValidator, TestValidator, CoverageValidator]
    And Redis queue "validation:queue" is available
    And Prometheus metrics exporter is running

  Scenario: Successful parallel validation (all validators PASSED)
    Given PR #123 has 3 files changed (2 Python, 1 TypeScript)
    When ValidationPipeline.validate(pr_id="123", files=["auth.py", "user.py", "utils.ts"]) is called
    Then all 3 validators execute in parallel (asyncio.gather)
    And LintValidator completes in <2 minutes (ruff + ESLint)
    And TestValidator completes in <5 minutes (pytest + vitest)
    And CoverageValidator completes in <5 minutes (pytest-cov)
    And PipelineResult.status = "PASSED"
    And PipelineResult.total_duration_ms <= 360000 (6 minutes)
    And Prometheus histogram "validation_pipeline_duration_seconds" is incremented
    And Prometheus counter "validation_pipeline_passed_total" is incremented

  Scenario: Partial failure (Lint FAILED, Tests PASSED, Coverage PASSED)
    Given PR #124 has Python code with linting errors (ruff: line too long, unused import)
    When ValidationPipeline.validate(pr_id="124", files=["models.py"]) is called
    Then LintValidator returns ValidatorResult(status="FAILED", message="2 linting errors found")
    And TestValidator returns ValidatorResult(status="PASSED", message="All 15 tests passed")
    And CoverageValidator returns ValidatorResult(status="PASSED", message="Coverage 92%")
    And PipelineResult.status = "FAILED"
    And PipelineResult.blocking_validators = ["LintValidator"]
    And PipelineResult.non_blocking_validators = []
    And PR #124 is blocked from merging (tier=PROFESSIONAL, lint is blocking)
    And Prometheus counter "validation_pipeline_failed_total" is incremented

  Scenario: Timeout protection (validator exceeds 10 minutes)
    Given TestValidator is running slow tests (execution time >10 minutes)
    When ValidationPipeline.validate(pr_id="125", files=["slow_test.py"]) is called with timeout=600s
    Then TestValidator is cancelled after 10 minutes (asyncio.wait_for timeout)
    And ValidatorResult(status="TIMEOUT", message="Validation exceeded 600s limit") is returned
    And PipelineResult.status = "ERROR"
    And PR #125 validation is retried (moved to validation:retry queue with retry_count=1)
    And Prometheus counter "validation_pipeline_timeout_total" is incremented

  Scenario: Non-blocking validator failure (Coverage FAILED in STANDARD tier)
    Given tier="STANDARD" (coverage is RECOMMENDED, not MANDATORY)
    And PR #126 has test coverage 75% (below 80% threshold)
    When ValidationPipeline.validate(pr_id="126", files=["service.py"]) is called
    Then CoverageValidator returns ValidatorResult(status="FAILED", message="Coverage 75% < 80%")
    And PipelineResult.status = "PASSED" (non-blocking failure)
    And PipelineResult.non_blocking_validators = ["CoverageValidator"]
    And PipelineResult.warnings = ["Coverage below 80% (current: 75%)"]
    And PR #126 is allowed to merge with warning (tier=STANDARD)
```

**Tier-Specific Requirements:**

| Requirement | LITE | STANDARD | PROFESSIONAL | ENTERPRISE |
|-------------|------|----------|--------------|------------|
| Lint validator | RECOMMENDED | MANDATORY | MANDATORY | MANDATORY |
| Test validator | OPTIONAL | RECOMMENDED | MANDATORY | MANDATORY |
| Coverage validator | OPTIONAL | RECOMMENDED | MANDATORY | MANDATORY |
| Coverage threshold | N/A | 70% | 80% | 90% |
| Parallel execution | YES | YES | YES | YES |
| Timeout per validator | 10 min | 10 min | 10 min | 10 min |
| Max pipeline duration | 15 min | 15 min | 15 min | 15 min |
| Retry on timeout | 1 retry | 2 retries | 3 retries | 3 retries |
| Blocking on lint failure | NO | YES | YES | YES |
| Blocking on test failure | NO | NO | YES | YES |
| Blocking on coverage failure | NO | NO | YES | YES |

**Acceptance Criteria:**

| ID | Criteria | Test Method | Expected Result |
|----|----------|-------------|-----------------|
| AC-001 | Pipeline executes 3 validators in parallel | Unit test with asyncio.gather mock | All validators start simultaneously (within 100ms) |
| AC-002 | Pipeline p95 latency <6 minutes | Load test with 100 PRs | 95% complete in <360s |
| AC-003 | Timeout protection at 10 minutes per validator | Integration test with slow validator | Validator cancelled, TIMEOUT status returned |
| AC-004 | Tier-based blocking logic (PROFESSIONAL blocks on coverage failure) | Unit test with tier="PROFESSIONAL", coverage=75% | PipelineResult.status = "FAILED", blocking |
| AC-005 | Non-blocking failure warning (STANDARD allows coverage failure) | Unit test with tier="STANDARD", coverage=75% | PipelineResult.status = "PASSED", warning added |
| AC-006 | Prometheus metrics incremented | Integration test with metrics mock | Histograms + counters updated correctly |

### FR-002: BaseValidator Abstract Class Interface

**Description**: BaseValidator defines the contract all validators must implement, with abstract validate() method, ValidatorResult return type, and timeout handling.

**BDD Requirements:**

```gherkin
Feature: BaseValidator Abstract Class
  As a Validator Developer
  I want a standard interface contract
  So that new validators can be added without changing pipeline code

  Background:
    Given BaseValidator abstract class is defined in validators/base.py
    And ValidatorResult dataclass is imported from validators/models.py
    And ABC (Abstract Base Class) module is available

  Scenario: Validator implements required interface
    Given CustomValidator class inherits from BaseValidator
    When CustomValidator defines async def validate(self, context: ValidationContext) -> ValidatorResult
    Then CustomValidator can be registered with ValidationPipeline
    And ValidationPipeline.validate() calls CustomValidator.validate() via polymorphism

  Scenario: Validator missing validate() method (abstract method not implemented)
    Given IncompleteValidator class inherits from BaseValidator
    But IncompleteValidator does NOT define validate() method
    When IncompleteValidator() is instantiated
    Then TypeError is raised with message "Can't instantiate abstract class IncompleteValidator with abstract method validate"
    And IncompleteValidator cannot be registered with ValidationPipeline

  Scenario: ValidatorResult return type validation
    Given LintValidator.validate() is called with ValidationContext(pr_id="123", files=["main.py"])
    When LintValidator returns invalid type (dict instead of ValidatorResult)
    Then ValidationPipeline raises TypeError: "Expected ValidatorResult, got <class 'dict'>"
    And Prometheus counter "validation_type_error_total" is incremented

  Scenario: Timeout handling via asyncio.wait_for
    Given BaseValidator.validate() has no built-in timeout (relies on pipeline timeout)
    When ValidationPipeline wraps validator with asyncio.wait_for(validator.validate(), timeout=600)
    And validator execution exceeds 600 seconds
    Then asyncio.TimeoutError is raised
    And ValidationPipeline catches exception, returns ValidatorResult(status="TIMEOUT")
```

**Tier-Specific Requirements:**

| Requirement | LITE | STANDARD | PROFESSIONAL | ENTERPRISE |
|-------------|------|----------|--------------|------------|
| Abstract validate() method | YES | YES | YES | YES |
| ValidatorResult return type | YES | YES | YES | YES |
| ValidationContext input type | YES | YES | YES | YES |
| Timeout handling (pipeline-level) | YES | YES | YES | YES |
| Exception handling (pipeline-level) | YES | YES | YES | YES |
| Type hints (Python 3.11+) | YES | YES | YES | YES |
| Docstring (Google style) | RECOMMENDED | RECOMMENDED | MANDATORY | MANDATORY |

**Acceptance Criteria:**

| ID | Criteria | Test Method | Expected Result |
|----|----------|-------------|-----------------|
| AC-007 | BaseValidator is abstract (cannot instantiate directly) | Unit test: BaseValidator() | TypeError raised |
| AC-008 | Subclass must implement validate() method | Unit test: class without validate() | TypeError on instantiation |
| AC-009 | validate() method signature enforced | Static type check with mypy | No type errors |
| AC-010 | ValidatorResult return type enforced | Runtime type check in pipeline | TypeError if wrong type returned |
| AC-011 | ValidationContext contains pr_id, files, tier, config | Unit test with ValidationContext creation | All fields populated correctly |

    And ruff returns exit code 0 (no errors)
    And ValidatorResult(status="PASSED", message="No linting errors (ruff)", details={}) is returned
    And execution time <2 minutes (p95)

  Scenario: Python file linting (ruff) - errors found
    Given PR #128 has Python file "models.py" with 2 linting errors:

    And ESLint returns exit code 0 (no errors)
    And ValidatorResult(status="PASSED", message="No linting errors (ESLint)", details={}) is returned

  Scenario: Mixed files (Python + TypeScript) - errors in both
    Given PR #130 has files: ["auth.py", "api.ts"]
    And "auth.py" has 1 ruff error (F401 unused import)
    And "api.ts" has 1 ESLint error (no-console)
    When LintValidator.validate(context) is called with files=["auth.py", "api.ts"]
    Then ruff and ESLint execute in parallel (asyncio.gather)
    And ValidatorResult(status="FAILED", message="2 linting errors found (1 ruff, 1 ESLint)", details={...}) is returned
    And details contain errors grouped by linter type

  Scenario: Linter command timeout (ruff exceeds 2 minutes)
    Given PR #131 has large Python file "huge_module.py" (10,000 LOC)
    When LintValidator.validate(context) is called with timeout=120s
    And ruff execution exceeds 2 minutes
    Then subprocess is killed (asyncio.wait_for timeout)
    And ValidatorResult(status="TIMEOUT", message="Linting exceeded 120s limit") is returned
```

### FR-006: Redis Queue Architecture

**Description**: Redis queue architecture provides asynchronous validation processing with FIFO queue, retry sorted set, and processing hash for distributed worker coordination.

**BDD Requirements:**

```gherkin
Feature: Redis Queue for Async Validation
  As a Backend Engineer
  I want asynchronous validation processing
  So that API responses are not blocked by long-running validators

  Background:
    Given Redis server is running (version 7.0+)
    And Redis queues are configured:
      | Queue Key | Type | Purpose |
      | validation:queue | LIST | FIFO queue for new validation requests |
      | validation:retry | ZSET | Sorted set for retry scheduling (score = retry_at timestamp) |
      | validation:processing | HASH | Hash of currently processing validations (key = pr_id, value = worker_id) |
    And ValidationWorker background process is running

  Scenario: Enqueue validation request (async API response)
    Given POST /api/v1/validations endpoint receives request: {"pr_id": "142", "files": ["auth.py"]}
    When ValidationService.enqueue_validation(pr_id="142", files=["auth.py"]) is called
    Then Redis RPUSH validation:queue '{"pr_id": "142", "files": ["auth.py"], "enqueued_at": "2026-01-31T10:00:00Z"}'
    And HTTP 202 Accepted response is returned immediately (no blocking)
    And Response body contains: {"validation_id": "val_142", "status": "PENDING", "queue_position": 5}
    And API response time <100ms (p95)

  Scenario: Worker dequeues and processes validation request
    Given validation:queue contains 3 pending requests
    When ValidationWorker calls Redis BLPOP validation:queue timeout=30
    Then oldest request is dequeued: {"pr_id": "142", "files": ["auth.py"]}
    And Redis HSET validation:processing "142" "worker_abc123"
    And ValidationPipeline.validate(pr_id="142", files=["auth.py"]) is executed
    And PipelineResult is stored in database (validation_results table)
    And Redis HDEL validation:processing "142" (remove from processing hash)
    And Prometheus gauge "validation_queue_processing_count" is decremented

  Scenario: Retry on timeout (exponential backoff)
    Given PR #143 validation timed out (retry_count=0)
    When ValidationWorker encounters timeout (ValidatorResult.status="TIMEOUT")
    Then retry_at = current_time + (10s * 2^retry_count) = current_time + 10s
    And Redis ZADD validation:retry retry_at {"pr_id": "143", "retry_count": 1}
    And ValidationWorker continues processing next item in queue (non-blocking)
    And After 10 seconds, ValidationWorker moves item from validation:retry to validation:queue
    And PR #143 is retried (retry_count=1)

  Scenario: Max retries exceeded (3 retries)
    Given PR #144 validation timed out 3 times (retry_count=3)
    When ValidationWorker encounters timeout again
    Then retry_count=4 exceeds max_retries=3
    And ValidatorResult(status="ERROR", message="Max retries (3) exceeded") is stored
    And Redis HDEL validation:processing "144"
    And PR #144 is marked as FAILED (no further retries)
    And Prometheus counter "validation_max_retries_exceeded_total" is incremented

  Scenario: Queue wait time monitoring (<30s p95)
    Given validation:queue has 10 pending requests
    When new validation is enqueued at timestamp T0
    And ValidationWorker dequeues request at timestamp T1
    Then queue_wait_time = T1 - T0
    And Prometheus histogram "validation_queue_wait_seconds" records queue_wait_time
    And Alert fires if p95 queue_wait_time >30 seconds
```

| Requirement | LITE | STANDARD | PROFESSIONAL | ENTERPRISE |
|-------------|------|----------|--------------|------------|
| Redis queue enabled | YES | YES | YES | YES |

### FR-007: Prometheus Metrics Integration

**Description**: Prometheus metrics track validation pipeline performance (duration histograms, result counters, queue gauges) for monitoring and alerting.

**BDD Requirements:**

```gherkin
Feature: Prometheus Metrics for Validation Pipeline
  As a DevOps Engineer
  I want Prometheus metrics for validation monitoring
  So that performance issues and failures are alerted

  Background:
    Given Prometheus exporter is running on port 9090
    And Grafana dashboard "Validation Pipeline" is configured
    And AlertManager is configured with validation alerts

  Scenario: Duration histogram (validation_pipeline_duration_seconds)
    Given ValidationPipeline.validate() completes in 3.5 minutes (210 seconds)
    When PipelineResult is returned
    Then Prometheus histogram "validation_pipeline_duration_seconds" is incremented with value 210
    And Histogram buckets: [30, 60, 120, 180, 240, 300, 360] (30s to 6min)
    And p95 latency can be queried: histogram_quantile(0.95, validation_pipeline_duration_seconds)

  Scenario: Result counters (validation_pipeline_passed_total, validation_pipeline_failed_total)
    Given ValidationPipeline.validate() returns PipelineResult(status="PASSED")
    When PipelineResult is returned
    Then Prometheus counter "validation_pipeline_passed_total" is incremented
    And Counter has labels: {tier="PROFESSIONAL", blocking="true"}
    And Counter can be queried: rate(validation_pipeline_passed_total[5m])

  Scenario: Queue gauges (validation_queue_size, validation_queue_processing_count)
    Given validation:queue has 15 pending requests
    And validation:processing has 3 active workers
    When ValidationWorker queries Redis queue
    Then Prometheus gauge "validation_queue_size" is set to 15
    And Prometheus gauge "validation_queue_processing_count" is set to 3
    And Gauges can be queried: validation_queue_size / validation_queue_processing_count (queue/worker ratio)

  Scenario: Alert firing (p95 latency >6 minutes)
    Given validation_pipeline_duration_seconds p95 is 8 minutes (480 seconds)
    And alerting rule: histogram_quantile(0.95, validation_pipeline_duration_seconds) > 360
    When AlertManager evaluates rule
    Then alert "ValidationPipelineSlowP95" fires
    And alert severity: WARNING
    And alert message: "Validation pipeline p95 latency (480s) exceeds 6 minutes threshold"
    And Slack notification sent to #platform-alerts channel
```

**Tier-Specific Requirements:**

| Requirement | LITE | STANDARD | PROFESSIONAL | ENTERPRISE |
|-------------|------|----------|--------------|------------|
| Prometheus metrics enabled | YES | YES | YES | YES |
| Duration histogram | YES | YES | YES | YES |
| Result counters (passed/failed/timeout/error) | YES | YES | YES | YES |
| Queue gauges (size/processing) | YES | YES | YES | YES |
| Validator-specific metrics | NO | YES | YES | YES |
| Grafana dashboard | NO | YES | YES | YES |
| AlertManager alerts | NO | NO | YES | YES |
| Metrics retention | 7 days | 14 days | 30 days | 90 days |

**Acceptance Criteria:**

| ID | Criteria | Test Method | Expected Result |
|----|----------|-------------|-----------------|
| AC-036 | Duration histogram incremented on pipeline complete | Integration test with mock Prometheus | Histogram value = actual duration |
| AC-037 | Result counters incremented per status | Unit test with PASSED/FAILED/TIMEOUT/ERROR | Counters increment correctly |
| AC-038 | Queue gauges reflect current queue state | Integration test with Redis queue | Gauges = actual queue size/processing count |
| AC-039 | Metrics exposed on /metrics endpoint | HTTP GET /metrics | Prometheus format metrics returned |
| AC-040 | Alert fires when p95 latency >6 minutes | Integration test with AlertManager mock | Alert triggered, Slack notification sent |
