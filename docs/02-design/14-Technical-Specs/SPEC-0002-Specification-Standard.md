## ❓ Problem Statement

### Business Problem

**Challenge**: Inconsistent specification formats across Framework 5.x led to:
- **Ambiguous requirements**: 40% of specs lacked clear acceptance criteria
- **Manual validation**: 15 hours/month spent verifying spec completeness
- **Tier confusion**: LITE vs ENTERPRISE requirements mixed in same section
- **Lost context**: 30% of specs missing ADR cross-references

**Impact**:
- **Orchestrator automation blocked**: Cannot parse specs without structured frontmatter
- **Compliance failures**: 25% of implementations missed tier-specific requirements
- **Onboarding friction**: New developers need 3+ days to understand spec format

### Technical Problem

**Challenge**: Framework 5.x specs used inconsistent formats:
- No machine-readable metadata (manual parsing required)
- Free-form requirements (difficult to validate completeness)
- Tier requirements scattered throughout document
- No standardized acceptance criteria format
- Inconsistent cross-referencing conventions

**Impact**:
- **No automation**: Evidence Vault cannot validate spec compliance
- **High maintenance**: 20 hours/quarter updating cross-references
- **Quality drift**: 35% of specs outdated within 6 months

### User Impact

**For Specification Authors**:
- 2+ hours per spec formatting and structuring
- Frequent rework due to missing required sections
- Unclear tier-specific requirement placement

**For Specification Consumers (Developers)**:
- 30+ minutes to find relevant tier requirements
- Difficulty tracing requirements to ADRs
- Ambiguous acceptance criteria interpretation

**For Automation (Orchestrator)**:
- Cannot validate spec compliance without manual review
- Cannot extract machine-readable requirements
- Cannot auto-generate compliance checklists

---

## ✅ Functional Requirements

All functional requirements follow **BDD (Behavior-Driven Development)** format for clarity and testability.

### FR-001: YAML Frontmatter Schema Validation

**Priority**: P0 (Critical)
**Complexity**: Medium
**Tier Applicability**: ALL (LITE, STANDARD, PROFESSIONAL, ENTERPRISE)

```gherkin
GIVEN a specification document with YAML frontmatter
  AND frontmatter contains required fields (spec_id, title, version, status, tier, pillar, owner, last_updated)
WHEN YAML parser validates frontmatter against spec-frontmatter-schema.json
THEN validation passes if all required fields present and valid
  AND spec_id matches pattern "^SPEC-[0-9]{4}$"
  AND version matches semantic versioning "^[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+$"
  AND status is one of [DRAFT, REVIEW, APPROVED, ACTIVE, DEPRECATED]
  AND tier is array of [LITE, STANDARD, PROFESSIONAL, ENTERPRISE]
  AND pillar matches pattern "^(Pillar [0-7]|Section [0-9]+).*$"
  AND last_updated is valid date format "YYYY-MM-DD"
```

**Rationale**: Machine-readable frontmatter enables Orchestrator automation, Evidence Vault validation, and compliance reporting.

**Dependencies**: JSON Schema validator (jsonschema library)

---

### FR-002: BDD Requirements Format

**Priority**: P0 (Critical)
**Complexity**: Low
**Tier Applicability**: ALL

```gherkin
GIVEN a functional requirement in specification
WHEN requirement is documented
THEN requirement MUST use GIVEN-WHEN-THEN format
  AND GIVEN clause describes preconditions and context
  AND WHEN clause describes the action or trigger
  AND THEN clause describes expected outcomes
  AND each requirement has priority (P0/P1/P2)
  AND each requirement has complexity (Low/Medium/High)
  AND each requirement has tier applicability
```

**Example**:
```gherkin
GIVEN a user with valid authentication token
  AND user has "admin" role
WHEN user requests to delete a project
THEN system validates ownership
  AND project is soft-deleted (archived)
  AND audit log records deletion event
```

**Rationale**: BDD format provides:
- **Testability**: Each requirement maps directly to test case
- **Clarity**: Eliminates ambiguous "shall/should/must" language
- **Stakeholder alignment**: Non-technical stakeholders understand scenarios

---

### FR-003: Tier-Specific Requirement Sections

**Priority**: P0 (Critical)
**Complexity**: Low
**Tier Applicability**: PROFESSIONAL, ENTERPRISE (LITE/STANDARD optional)

```gherkin
GIVEN a specification applicable to multiple tiers
WHEN specification includes tier-specific requirements
THEN specification MUST have "Tier-Specific Requirements" section
  AND section contains subsections for each applicable tier
  AND LITE tier requirements listed first (if applicable)
  AND STANDARD tier requirements listed second (if applicable)
  AND PROFESSIONAL tier requirements listed third (if applicable)
  AND ENTERPRISE tier requirements listed fourth (if applicable)
  AND each tier subsection documents differences from base requirements
```

**Example**:
```markdown
## Tier-Specific Requirements

### LITE Tier
- WARNING mode only (no blocking)
- Manual approval required for all gates

### PROFESSIONAL Tier
- SOFT enforcement (block with override)
- 2+ approvers required for Red zone PRs

### ENTERPRISE Tier
- FULL enforcement (hard-block)
- Kill switch enabled
- CTO override required for Red zone PRs
```

**Rationale**: Clear tier separation prevents confusion and ensures correct implementation for each customer segment.

---

### FR-004: Acceptance Criteria Table Format

**Priority**: P0 (Critical)
**Complexity**: Low
**Tier Applicability**: ALL

```gherkin
GIVEN a specification with acceptance criteria
WHEN acceptance criteria are documented
THEN criteria MUST be in table format with columns:
  | Criterion | Expected Result | Test Method | Priority |
  AND each criterion has unique ID (AC-001, AC-002, etc.)
  AND expected result is measurable and verifiable
  AND test method specifies how to validate (unit/integration/E2E)
  AND priority is P0 (must-pass) or P1 (should-pass)
  AND table includes minimum 5 criteria per specification
```

**Example**:
```markdown
| Criterion | Expected Result | Test Method | Priority |
|-----------|----------------|-------------|----------|
| AC-001: Frontmatter validation | 100% specs pass YAML validation | Unit test (jsonschema) | P0 |
| AC-002: BDD format compliance | All FRs use GIVEN-WHEN-THEN | Regex pattern match | P0 |
| AC-003: Tier section presence | PROFESSIONAL+ specs have tier sections | Document structure check | P0 |
```

**Rationale**: Structured acceptance criteria enable:
- **Automated validation**: CI/CD can verify criteria programmatically
- **Clear success definition**: No ambiguity on what "done" means
- **Prioritization**: P0 vs P1 guides testing focus

---

### FR-005: Cross-Reference Conventions

**Priority**: P1 (High)
**Complexity**: Low
**Tier Applicability**: ALL

```gherkin
GIVEN a specification that relates to other documents
WHEN cross-references are documented
THEN frontmatter MUST include related_adrs array
  AND frontmatter MUST include related_specs array
  AND each ADR reference uses format "ADR-XXX-Title"
  AND each spec reference uses format "SPEC-XXXX"
  AND specification body uses markdown links to references
  AND link format is [ADR-XXX](../../02-design/03-ADRs/ADR-XXX-Title.md)
  AND link format is [SPEC-XXXX](./SPEC-XXXX-Title.md)
```

**Example**:
```yaml
related_adrs:
  - ADR-035-Governance-System-Design
  - ADR-041-Stage-Dependency-Matrix
related_specs:
  - SPEC-0001-Anti-Vibecoding
  - SPEC-0003-Quality-Gates-Codegen-Specification
```

**Rationale**: Explicit cross-references enable:
- **Traceability**: Track requirements back to design decisions
- **Impact analysis**: Find all specs affected by ADR change
- **Context preservation**: Understand why decisions were made

---

### FR-006: Implementation Plan Template

**Priority**: P1 (High)
**Complexity**: Low
**Tier Applicability**: PROFESSIONAL, ENTERPRISE

```gherkin
GIVEN a specification for PROFESSIONAL or ENTERPRISE tier
WHEN specification includes implementation guidance
THEN specification MUST include "Implementation Plan" section
  AND section contains 3-7 phases
  AND each phase has name, duration estimate, and deliverables
  AND phases are ordered chronologically
  AND phase dependencies are explicitly stated
  AND critical path is identified
```

**Example**:
```markdown
## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Schema Definition (1 week)
**Deliverables**:
- spec-frontmatter-schema.json created
- Validation script (validate_frontmatter.py)
- 10 test cases for edge cases

**Dependencies**: None (foundational)
**Critical Path**: YES
```

**Rationale**: Implementation plan provides:
- **Roadmap clarity**: Teams know sequence of work
- **Effort estimation**: Supports sprint planning
- **Dependency management**: Prevents blocking issues

---

### FR-007: Design Decision Documentation

**Priority**: P1 (High)
**Complexity**: Low
**Tier Applicability**: ALL

```gherkin
GIVEN a specification with key design choices
WHEN design decisions are documented
THEN specification MUST include "Design Decisions" section
  AND section lists 2-5 major decisions
  AND each decision has:
    - Decision statement (what was chosen)
    - Rationale (why it was chosen)
    - Alternatives considered (what was rejected and why)
    - Consequences (trade-offs and impacts)
```

**Example**:
```markdown
## Design Decisions

### Decision 1: YAML Frontmatter (Not JSON)

**Rationale**:
- YAML more human-readable than JSON
- Supports comments (useful for spec authors)
- Consistent with Framework 5.x convention

**Alternatives Considered**:
- JSON frontmatter → Rejected (no comments, verbose)
- TOML frontmatter → Rejected (less ecosystem support)

**Consequences**:
- Requires YAML parser (PyYAML dependency)
- More complex parsing than JSON
- Better developer experience (comments, readability)
```

**Rationale**: Design decision documentation:
- **Preserves context**: Future teams understand "why"
- **Prevents rework**: Avoids revisiting rejected alternatives
- **Facilitates reviews**: Reviewers see trade-offs explicitly

---

### FR-008: Specification Metadata Completeness

**Priority**: P0 (Critical)
**Complexity**: Low
**Tier Applicability**: ALL

```gherkin
GIVEN a specification document
WHEN specification frontmatter is validated
THEN frontmatter MUST include all required fields:
  - spec_version (semantic version)
  - spec_id (SPEC-XXXX format)
  - spec_name (human-readable title)
  - status (DRAFT/REVIEW/APPROVED/ACTIVE/DEPRECATED)
  - tier (array of applicable tiers)
  - stage (00-10)
  - category (e.g., governance, security, performance)
  - owner (role or team name)
  - created (YYYY-MM-DD)
  - last_updated (YYYY-MM-DD)
  - related_adrs (array, may be empty)
  - related_specs (array, may be empty)
  - framework_version (e.g., SDLC 6.0.0)
  - machine_readable_spec (path to YAML/JSON, if exists)
  - tags (array of searchable keywords)
```

**Rationale**: Complete metadata enables:
- **Automated indexing**: Evidence Vault can catalog all specs
- **Compliance tracking**: Know which specs apply to which tiers
- **Search and discovery**: Tags facilitate finding relevant specs
- **Lifecycle management**: Status field tracks spec evolution

---

## 🎯 Non-Functional Requirements

### NFR-001: Validation Performance

**Requirement**: YAML frontmatter validation completes in <100ms for 100 concurrent specs.

**Measurement**:
```python
# pytest-benchmark test
def test_frontmatter_validation_performance(benchmark):
    specs = load_100_specs()
    result = benchmark(validate_all_specs, specs)
    assert result.stats.mean < 0.1  # 100ms
```

**Tier Applicability**: PROFESSIONAL, ENTERPRISE

---

### NFR-002: Specification Readability

**Requirement**: Specifications achieve Flesch-Kincaid readability score >60 (college-level readable).

**Measurement**:
- Automated readability checker in CI/CD
- Reject specs with score <60
- Provide rewrite suggestions for complex sentences

**Tier Applicability**: ALL

---

### NFR-003: Cross-Reference Integrity

**Requirement**: 100% of cross-references (related_adrs, related_specs) resolve to existing documents.

**Measurement**:
```python
def test_cross_references_valid():
    for spec in all_specs:
        for adr_ref in spec.related_adrs:
            assert adr_file_exists(adr_ref)
        for spec_ref in spec.related_specs:
            assert spec_file_exists(spec_ref)
```

**Tier Applicability**: ALL

---

### NFR-004: Specification Versioning

**Requirement**: Specification version updates follow semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH).

**Versioning Rules**:
- **MAJOR**: Breaking changes (e.g., required field removed)
- **MINOR**: New fields added (backward compatible)
- **PATCH**: Typo fixes, clarifications (no schema change)

**Tier Applicability**: ALL

---

---

## 🧠 Design Decisions

### Decision 1: YAML Frontmatter (Not JSON or TOML)

**Decision**: Use YAML for specification frontmatter metadata.

**Rationale**:
1. **Human-readable**: YAML more readable than JSON (no quotes/braces clutter)
2. **Comments supported**: Authors can document field purposes inline
3. **Consistency**: Framework 5.x already uses YAML for configuration
4. **Ecosystem maturity**: PyYAML, js-yaml, ruamel.yaml are stable

**Alternatives Considered**:
- **JSON frontmatter**:
  - ✅ Simpler parsing (built-in JSON module)
  - ❌ No comments (harder for spec authors)
  - ❌ More verbose (quotes required for all keys/values)
  - **Rejected**: Developer experience inferior

- **TOML frontmatter**:
  - ✅ Comments supported
  - ✅ Strongly typed
  - ❌ Less ecosystem support (fewer tools)
  - ❌ Unfamiliar to most developers
  - **Rejected**: Adoption friction too high

**Consequences**:
- **Positive**:
  - Specification authors find format intuitive
  - Comments improve maintainability (e.g., "# Required by Evidence Vault")
  - Consistent with existing Framework conventions
- **Negative**:
  - Requires YAML parser dependency (PyYAML ~500KB)
  - YAML indentation errors possible (mitigated by linter)
  - Slightly slower parsing than JSON (<10ms difference)

**Decision Date**: 2026-01-27
**Decision Owner**: CTO + Framework Architect

---

### Decision 2: BDD (GIVEN-WHEN-THEN) Over Traditional "Shall/Should/Must"

**Decision**: Mandate BDD format for all functional requirements in Framework 6.0.0 specifications.

**Rationale**:
1. **Testability**: Each BDD scenario maps 1:1 to test case
2. **Clarity**: Eliminates ambiguous language ("system should..." → what does "should" mean?)
3. **Stakeholder alignment**: Non-technical stakeholders (Product, QA) understand scenarios
4. **Behavior-focused**: Describes "what" system does, not "how" it's implemented

**Alternatives Considered**:
- **Traditional RFC 2119 keywords** (SHALL, SHOULD, MUST):
  - ✅ Industry standard (ISO, IETF use it)
  - ❌ Ambiguous priority (what's difference between SHALL and MUST?)
  - ❌ Not testable (how do you test "system SHALL be fast"?)
  - **Rejected**: Leads to vague, untestable requirements

- **User story format** (As a... I want... So that...):
  - ✅ User-centric perspective
  - ❌ Too high-level for technical specs
  - ❌ Doesn't specify preconditions/postconditions clearly
  - **Rejected**: Better for product backlogs, not technical specs

**Consequences**:
- **Positive**:
  - 100% of requirements are testable (no ambiguity)
  - QA team can generate test cases directly from specs
  - Fewer requirements disputes during reviews
- **Negative**:
  - Longer to write (BDD more verbose than "system shall...")
  - Learning curve for traditional spec authors (~1 day training)
  - Some simple requirements seem over-specified

**Mitigation**:
- Provide BDD templates and examples
- Offer 1-day BDD training for spec authors
- Allow simplified format for trivial requirements (e.g., "WHEN user clicks logout THEN session terminates")

**Decision Date**: 2026-01-27
**Decision Owner**: CTO + Quality Lead

---

### Decision 3: Tier-Specific Sections (Not Inline Conditionals)

**Decision**: Create separate "Tier-Specific Requirements" sections instead of inline conditionals (e.g., "if ENTERPRISE tier, then...").

**Rationale**:
1. **Readability**: Separate sections easier to scan than scattered conditionals
2. **Maintainability**: Changes to one tier don't affect others
3. **Clarity**: No confusion about which requirements apply to which tier
4. **Automation-friendly**: Parser can extract tier-specific sections easily

**Alternatives Considered**:
- **Inline conditionals**:
  ```markdown
  **FR-001**: System validates input.
  - If LITE tier: Manual validation
  - If PROFESSIONAL tier: Automated validation
  - If ENTERPRISE tier: Automated + audit log
  ```
  - ❌ Cluttered (requirements repeated with variations)
  - ❌ Hard to parse (conditionals scattered throughout)
  - **Rejected**: Scales poorly with many tiers

- **Separate specification files per tier**:
  - `SPEC-0001-Anti-Vibecoding-LITE.md`
  - `SPEC-0001-Anti-Vibecoding-ENTERPRISE.md`
  - ❌ Duplication (90% of content identical)
  - ❌ Maintenance burden (change in one → update all)
  - **Rejected**: Too much overhead

**Consequences**:
- **Positive**:
  - Developers see only relevant tier requirements
  - Easier to validate tier compliance
  - Less duplication than separate files
- **Negative**:
  - Spec longer (tier sections add ~200-300 lines)
  - Authors must remember to update all applicable tiers

**Mitigation**:
- Provide tier section template
- CI/CD checker warns if tier sections missing for multi-tier specs

**Decision Date**: 2026-01-27
**Decision Owner**: Framework Architect + Product Manager
